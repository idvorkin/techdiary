## Make linqpad work with redshift.

Sounds easy there is already a  [linqpad driver for postrgres SQL](https://github.com/fknx/linqpad-postgresql-driver) which wraps a C# driver for postrgres SQL which support redshift [ngpsql](https://blog.rthand.com/post/2016/09/19/linqpad-llblgenpro-and-npgsql.aspx).

But hold your horses, reshift support for ngpsql was added after the linqpad driver was last compiled, so we'll need to update it to avoid software rot.

To build linqpad-driver need to start by setting $env:LINQPAD_HOME before launch the sln file.

Update nuget packages to latest versions
Update gitignore to clean up generated goop.

Issues:

* How to run tests (need localhost DB)
* How to run in linqpad (no lpx generated?)

## Debugging: connecting to Redshift from Windows

Install PSQL 
```
    chocolatey package is crufy, install directly from website.

```

Need to set encoding: 
```
set PGCLIENTENCODING=UTF8 
```


Launch psql 
```
"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin\psql.exe"
psql -h idvorkin1.co7ezfmxj5tg.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com -p 5439 -d idvorkin1 -U idvorkin
```

See tables
```
idvorkin1=# SELECT distinct(schemaname)  from pg_catalog.pg_tables;

     schemaname
--------------------
 information_schema
 pg_catalog
 ```

Describe
```
\d # describe tables
\d <tablename> # describe columns
\dn List schemas
 ```

 Change Schema
 ```
 SET  search_path TO public;
 SET  search_path TO public
 ```
 Reverse engineer using peewee:
 ```
 python -m pwiz -H idvorkin1.co7ezfmxj5tg.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com -p 5439 -e postgresql -u idvorkin idvorkin1 -P idvorkin1
 ```

Create helper table (notice no primary key as serial columns are **not** supported):
```
CREATE TABLE scratch( username VARCHAR (50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, password VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR (355) UNIQUE NOT NULL, created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, last_login TIMESTAMP);
```
