## Success Critera

* App to help me manage my life on my iPad
* Learn React Native Development
* Easy to add day by day capabilities

## Use cases - Functional

### Develop in Expo

### Use typescript with React Native


## Use cases - In Progress

### Cut friction in creating daily journal entries.

* A) Copy the words "Gratefulness {today's date} to the clipboard
* B) Create and navigate to notability for this.

###  Create a list of calendar events for the day: 

* Things 3 does a really pretty day view as an image.
* Enumerating the calendar is pretty easy. However, can only copy text (not html or image to clipboard), consider loading a remote image that is generated from the calendar data so it can be pretty.

## Notes

Easy react development from windows -  [Expo](https://expo.io/)

    CRNA - Create React Native App, 
    Only works with npm 4 grah. 

React native binds to wrong network address:

    set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=192.168.0.22
    REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME='my-custom-ip-address-or-hostname' 
    npm start

Install watchman to get file refreshses

    set PATH=%PATH%;c:\users\idvor\watchman
