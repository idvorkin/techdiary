## Why?

When I started programming ML was very weak, and I basically ignored it. Like all technology, ML has gotten cheaper and more powerful. And like many hot technologies, it's become full of hype. Here's my attempt to build a high level understanding of ML

### Success Critera

* I have a good enough understanding of ML to tell if someone is full of shit.
* I can explain ML to a PM or executive.
* I know the problems ML can solve.
* I know the common words used in ML.
* I can make some PoC projects to test my understanding.
* I can tell if a problem can be solved by ML.
* I can keep track of the ML concepts I've learned and cross check them with a PhD.

## ML at 10,000 feet


### What problems can ML solve

Classification
Regression
Clustering
Dimension Reduction

Model Selection
Preprocessing


### How to measure the effectivness of ML


#### Precision and Recall
#### Accuracy

## Misc

### Why is ML stuff so complicated

### Why can't big computer do all of it

### Why GPU vs CPU

CPU's are optimized for integer operations on few threads (E.g. high end CPU has 8 threads). GPUs are optimized for parallel floating point optimization (E.g.high end GPU has 560K threads).

### What is tensor flow

Tensor flow is a library that lets you describe the math, and have the math be comiled to GPU/CPU on device ML processors.

### Tensor flow is hard, are there alternatives

#### What does on device ML cores do

### Model building vs Model Execution

### Computation power required for cat pictures

### ML Optical Illusions
