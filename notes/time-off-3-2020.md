1. Hold each othe accountable
1. Deliver value

Quick notes [here](https://github.com/idvorkin/techdiary/blob/9e8e206a80219db32277459b00ae6773e3b61e62/notes/hack-web.md#fly-out-toc)

☑ Digraphs to support TODO and not-TODO

Digraphs let you use completion without needing GHFM which only works in lists.

☑ FZF super powers

Have C-O open interesting files across my repros and move there

☑ tags

Turns out there's a new version of [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/homebrew-universal-ctags), that support markdown, which you want for fzf :Tags

Also build interesting tag files for a markdown repo, by only using fd, which honors .gitignore

    ctags `fd md$`

1. Subscribed to rss feed for reddit via https://reddit/r/subreddit.rss
