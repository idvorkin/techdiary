# Hacking the web for fun and profit`

Now a days javascript and HTML are the assembly language of the web (I first [said this in 2012](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/2012/05/assembly-to-javascript-tsrs-to.html)). While still stuff is fun, it's very brittle because 1) the approach is brittle, and 2) everytime the code changes, which it will everything will break.

## Script Injection

### Bookmarklets

Turns out you can stick javascript in the address bar, that's a bookmarklet. Here it is from the [way back machine](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/2012/05/assembly-to-javascript-tsrs-to.html))

### Grease Monkey

Called Taper Monkey for chrome, it autoloads a script when you enter a webpage. Useful to personalize websites via css and javascript.

## Console Tricks

### Load Jquery

### CSS selectors

I always forget these, but it matters as that's how you select elements in jquery

A full [summary](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp), below are some I often use.

- \$(.class)
- \$(#id)
- \$(element) #e.g. h1

When nesting selectors here are the [operators](https://techbrij.com/css-selector-adjacent-child-sibling)

* space - decendant at any level
* > - immediate decendant
* + - Adjecent (e.g. sibling)
* ~  - Not  Adjecent (e.g. not sibling)

## Debugging 101

### Chrome Keyboard shortcuts

https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts

| Key   | Command                       |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| C-S-I | Enter dev tools               |
| C-S-M | Toggle Mobile Emulator        |
| C-S-R | Hard reload (breaking cache)  |
| C-S-P | Command Pallette (super cool) |


### Force reloading

Often needed for CSS -

* A) C-S-R
* Network Tab -> Disable caching

### Capturing an object for later use

Often there's a useful object, that's only available in the closure. You can always assign a refernce on window e.g.

    window.foo = foo_from_within_a_closure_found_from_debugging

### Black boxing

### Event Handlers

## Real life examples

These should break all the time, and be of minimal interst to anyone but Igor, but it's my blog so there.


### Automating todo item creation in omnifocus for web

**Too painful - got into some react/redux sync model, gave up**

Ominfocus doesn't supprot APIs, so we need to automate the web.

In omnifocus, you can add a task by pressing the 'c' key, which brings up a dialog. We can "hook that", by setting a breakpoing on global keypress events.

From there, we get into a closure that has an interesting object. Copy that to global scope.

## Fly out TOC

I started by trying to create this myself, but as with most "build" vs "buy", you're better off stealing and buying. Looks like this exists in:

### CSS

* Foundation - called [magellon](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/magellan.html)
* Bootstrap - called [scroll spy](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/scrollspy/)

### Javscript Reverse Engineering Fly out TOC

Looks like the CSS needs to have the data setup correctly. I found some javascript to do this in [hackmd](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/search?q=generateToc&unscoped_q=generateToc), and started putzing with it. Looks like that gets me the DOM in the form I need.
