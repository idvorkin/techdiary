### Photos

- Take picture by pressing power up.
- Hey Siri take a selfie
- App: LightX

## Apps

### All

- Just press record - Keep full voice recording (not just transcription) 
- Fantastical - Best Calender app - period.
- Magic Launcher - Cool idea, app launch from widget menu.
- Dark Sky - Micro weather
- Bear - Writing tool.
- MOSH - ssh but much better.
- LightX - photo editor with magic wand.

### Chrome

I use chrome instead of safari since it syncronizes my passwords and my open tabs. Chrome gestures:

Gestures:

Back/Forward - Swipe Left/Right from page edge
Switch tabs - Swipe Left/Right on address bar.
Refresh Tab - Pull top of page down.
Close Tab - Pull top of page down and to right
New Tab - Pull top of page down and to left

Keyboard: Test if these work

## Pen 

### Notability 
   
 Syncronized audio playback and writing

### Notes Plus 
 
  * Prettiest Render
  * Very simple iCloud sync format
  * Smart Gestures (Scratch to erase, deduce shape)
  * Good OCR

### OneNote
   
* Best cross platform app
* Hand writing in native, but it’s meh compared to the others 

### Adobe Sketch

  * My favorite drawing app - nice intuitive controls
  * Nice ink
 

### Inkflow

  * I haven’t actually used it, but apparently it can turn photos into vector graphics (pretty cool)

### Nebo

  * Augmented drawing. Cool idea you can draw connected diagrams and move them around, but it feels great for a demo, but doesn’t actually work well yet.
