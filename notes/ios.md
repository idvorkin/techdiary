### HomeKit

### Health Kit

[QS Access](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qs-access/id920297614?mt=8) - Allow you to export your health data in tabular format - pretty nice.
Sleep cycle - Smart wake up alarm.
Heart Watch - Crazy level of detail on your heart rate.
Auto Sleep - Watch based sleep tracking.

### Photos

- Take picture by pressing volume up.
- Hey Siri take a selfie
- App: LightX

### Gestures

- Press on Time - Scroll to top of page.

## Apps

### All

- Just press record - Keep full voice recording (not just transcription)
- Fantastical - Best Calender app - period.
- Magic Launcher - Cool idea, app launch from widget menu.
- Dark Sky - Micro weather
- Bear - Writing tool
- LightX - photo editor with magic wand.

### Chrome

I use chrome instead of safari since it syncronizes my passwords and my open tabs. Chrome gestures:

Gestures:

Back/Forward - Swipe Left/Right from page edge
Switch tabs - Swipe Left/Right on address bar.
Refresh Tab - Pull top of page down.
Close Tab - Pull top of page down and to right
New Tab - Pull top of page down and to left

Keyboard: Test if these work

### Launcher

A launch center which can execute url's best use case is from a today widget.

### Workflow

Automate common tasks - like send text to person (which can be added as a share extension) and send last screen shot to person. Can also add "shortcuts" to launcher.

## Watch

## Augmented Reality Apps

- IKEA: Put ikea furniture in your room.
- MagicPlan: Determine floor plan interactively.
- LightSpace: Paint in AR
- AR Dragon: Play with a toy dragon

## Pen

### Notability

 * My recommended writing application.
 * Synchronized audio playback and writing
 * Nice iCloud syncing
 * Google Drive PDF creation
 * Excellent Hand Writing Recognition and search.
 * Side by side page view

### Notes Plus

I now recommend using Notability, however a few places where Notes Plus still has superior features:

  * Prettiest Render
  * Smart Gestures (Scratch to erase, deduce shape)

### OneNote

* Best cross platform app
* Hand writing in native, but it's meh compared to the others

### Adobe Sketch

  * My favorite drawing app - nice intuitive controls
  * Nice ink

### Inkflow

  * I haven't actually used it, but apparently it can turn photos into vector graphics (pretty cool)

### Nebo

  * Augmented drawing. Cool idea you can draw connected diagrams and move them around, but it feels great for a demo, but doesnâ€™t actually work well yet.

### Keyboards

* Google Keyboard - lets you use a swype like gesture
* Stylus  - lets you write by actually writing on the screen (similar to windows ink)

## Development

* Working Copy - the best git (only?) git edior
* MOSH - ssh but much better.
* Editorial - Markdown editor that can interact with Working Copy  (seems nicer then ByWord)
* ByWord - Markdown editor that can interact with Working Copy
