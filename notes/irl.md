## Physical Health

- [Physical Health](https://idvorkin.github.io/physical-health) - My original article on physical health
- [Tech for health](http://idvorkin.github.io/tech-health-toys) - A list of tech products I've used and tried.

### Calf Health

When I crossed 40 I went from easily running 4 miles hard and 20 mile bike rides to have my calfs lock up after 20 minutes of biking. I've tried various calf things here's my current list:

- [Calf rocker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HTFZZ8/ref=emc_b_5_t) I have the single and double, best, simple stretch
- [Neoprene Calf Sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/Support-Brace-Adjustable-Splint-Compression/dp/B074734XJY/) I've tried socks but they are a pain to get on, and not adjustable. These things wrap on, keep you warm, and are wonderful. Highly recommend.

### Knee Health

Lots of sleeves out there, I recommend the most flexible one that provides the pain relief. For me that:

- [Knee brace Softest ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BINV84/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Knee brace more support ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GDFN6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Knee Strap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GDFN6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MYGDB2L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Booger Health

For much of my 30's I had a brutal hacking cough. At 41, those coughs were causing me to pull out my shoulder muscles so I decided to take Flonase (I knew it was post nasal drip). I started taking Flonase, and I'm blown away by not coughing up a hairball.

### Skin Health

I suffer from Eczema, which I normally ignore. I took some of my son's topical steroids, and I kid you not, it cleared up in 2 days.

I also have dry skin, so use O'Keeffe's which is awesome.

### Standing Desks

### Gym Stuff

With age comes the need for more accouterments

- Headphones
- Dry bag for iPad
- Eye Drop (Blink)
- Shaving Kit
- Netflix downloaded shows

### Under Desk Exercise Equipment

I don't use this, but it's under my desk. The day I got it and used it, I decided it was a good idea and I should use it more often.

## Emotional Health

### Meditation

I used to have a complex meditation routine, which was very "focused", but had too much complexity. I skipped it and now use headspace, and do it slouching in a chair. Huge improvement.

Also, if you're interested in why start meditating, read "Search Inside Yourself"

**OLD**

I meditate kneeling (Seiza) and have two benches. Meditation benches are over priced, but if it improves my emotional health (and it's supposed to) it's worth it.

Even though this is folding, this is my permanent bench:

This is my portable bench, it's smaller, but less stable, but it does the job:

## Cognitive Health

## Identity Health

## Personal Carry

### Fanny Pack

Don't get me started on the perfect fanny pack. My current favorite is below. It's very tactical looking - but have to start somewhere.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JJYCTST

### Gym Bag

I often stuff the gym bag in a larger bag so small matters - I use:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SJ5XSB2

### Work Bag

It's taken me several tries, but I've concluded I like the smallest bag possible. I use a 13" macbook pro laptop and an iPad Pro 10" and this is the perfect bag for me:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNPPF72

There's also the horizontal version - which is slightly bigger but also nice:

## Car Tech

I've gotten 3 cheap pieces of aftermarket tech that transformed my car to awesomeness:

- Remote car starter - ~ 200\$ and you can start your car from the house so that it's warm and toasty when you get in.
- Wireless Air Play - ~ 500\$. OMG - having CarPlay (especially on iOS 13) without plugging in your phone - wow!
- Back up Camera ~ 30\$. OMG - Hard to believe I went years without one.

## Morning Routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

I also love getting my morning hug from my kids, but now that Zach's older (9), I'm down to just getting the hugs from Amelia - who is 5.

### Weekend morning routine

On the weekends, the gym opens at 8, so it's essential I drink my coffee in my home office chair so I work on whatever is most important to me, often reading or writing. At 7:30 it's time to drag my but to the gym.

Post gym I'll either hit the coffee shop to do some more writing, or head home to spend the day with my family.

### Weekday morning routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

The gym opens at 5:30, and I try to be there by 6. After my work out, I often chillax with my next priority being walking the kids to school. Walking the kids to school has surprisingly been a major quality of life improvement for a very small impact to my day.

### Morning Kryptonite

I have two common failure modes to my morning routine.

- Starting my day by sitting in my easy chair drinking my coffee. This mindless activity has me skipping those things that are important to me.
- Hitting snooze when my alarm goes off. The worst of all words, not sleeping, and not being up and doing stuff.
- Lying in bed awake when I wake up before 5. Sometimes I wake up and can't fall back asleep @ 3 or 4 (which isn't crazy cuz sometimes I go to bed @ 7 or 8). Similar to hitting snooze, I'm not sleeping, and I'm not accomplishing anything.

## Tech Stuff

- iPhone Pro
- iPad Pro
- Apple Pencil
- Bluetooth Folding Split Keyboard
- AirPod Pros
- Bose 900 - Retired for the AirPod Pros
- Foam Tips for AirPod Pros - highly recommend if you're used to foam tips.
- iPad stand.

### Computers

- Huawei Matebook X (Essentially Windows Macbook clone):w
- Macbook Pro (usually at work)
- Ancient Desktop (upgrade coming)

### Monitors

- 34" wide screen - not a huge fan. Good for wide screen movies (but Netflix/YouTube rarely has this resolution)
- 40" 3840x2160 - Awesome, I love it! Highly recommend
