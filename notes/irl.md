## Physical Health

- [Physical Health](https://idvorkin.github.io/physical-health) - My original article on physical health
- [Tech for health](http://idvorkin.github.io/tech-health-toys) - A list of tech products I've used and tried.

### Calf Health

When I crossed 40 I went from easily running 4 miles hard and 20 mile bike rides to have my calfs lock up after 20 minutes of biking. I've tried various calf things here's my current list:

- [Calf rocker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HTFZZ8/ref=emc_b_5_t) I have the single and double, best, simple stretch
- [Neoprene Calf Sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/Support-Brace-Adjustable-Splint-Compression/dp/B074734XJY/) I've tried socks but they are a pain to get on, and not adjustable. These things wrap on, keep you warm, and are wonderful. Highly recommend.

### Knee Health

Lots of sleeves out there, I recommend the most flexible one that provides the pain relief. For me that:

- [Knee brace Softest ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BINV84/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Knee brace more support ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GDFN6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Knee Strap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GDFN6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MYGDB2L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Booger Health

For much of my 30's I had a brutal hacking cough. At 41, those coughs were causing me to pull out my shoulder muscles so I decided to take Flonase (I knew it was post nasal drip). I started taking Flonase, and I'm blown away by not coughing up a hairball.

### Skin Health

I suffer from Eczema, which I normally ignore. I took some of my son's topical steroids, and I kid you not, it cleared up in 2 days.

I also have dry skin, so use O'Keeffe's which is awesome.

### Standing Desks

### Gym Stuff

With age comes the need for more accouterments

- Headphones
- Dry bag for iPad
- Eye Drop (Blink)
- Shaving Kit
- Netflix downloaded shows

### Under Desk Exercise Equipment

I don't use this, but it's under my desk. The day I got it and used it, I decided it was a good idea and I should use it more often.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KMNVXCT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

## Emotional Health

### Meditation

I used to have a complex meditation routine, which was very "focused", but had too much complexity. I skipped it and now use headspace, and do it slouching in a chair. Huge improvement.

Also, if you're interested in why start meditating, read "Search Inside Yourself"

**OLD**

I meditate kneeling (Seiza) and have two benches. Meditation benches are over priced, but if it improves my emotional health (and it's supposed to) it's worth it.

Even though this is folding, this is my permanent bench:

This is my portable bench, it's smaller, but less stable, but it does the job:

## Cognitive Health

## Identity Health

## Personal Carry

### Fanny Pack

Don't get me started on the perfect fanny pack. My current favorite is below. It's very tactical looking - but have to start somewhere.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JJYCTST

### Gym Bag

I often stuff the gym bag in a larger bag so small matters - I use:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SJ5XSB2

### Work Bag

It's taken me several tries, but I've concluded I like the smallest bag possible. I use a 13" macbook pro laptop and an iPad Pro 10" and this is the perfect bag for me:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNPPF72

There's also the horizontal version - which is slightly bigger but also nice:

## Bikes

I **love** not driving. Biking is an awesome form of transit. It took a while but I concluded I have several use cases so need several bikes. In fact,

### Folding Bike - The Brompton

A folding bike is great for reasonable distances because it's easy to fold it up and carry it onto public transit, fold it up to bring it inside, or through it into the trunk of a car. The most important criteria for me on folding bikes is ease of folding and folded dimensions. In this domain the Brompton is the winner hands down. If you have a Brompton check out my [accouterments recommendations](ike://www.idvork.in/brompton-toys#undefined).

### E-bike theory

E-bikes require some new concepts, here's the results of my learning.

#### Mid vs Rear drive

There are multiple approaches to powering an e-bike: 1) have the motor spin the wheel directly, aka rear drive, or 2) have the motor simulate spinning the pedals aka mid drive. The big difference between rear and mid drive is a mid drive can use gears which solves torque, which we'll get to in a second.

Even though the mid-drive can use your gears, it turns out gears and chains are designed to powered by humans, and if you stick a big motor into them the chains tend to break. As a result, unless you want to be doing on the road maintenance your mid-drive drive motor tends to be limited to 350 watts, about the power of having you augmented with an Olympic bike cycle racers.

By contrast rear motors don't use your chain, so they can be more powerful, much more powerful. However, just like it's really hard for you to get up a hill when pedaling, especially from a dead stop, it's also really hard for your motor because of torque. The solution for humans is gears, which gives you mechanical advantage, e.g. the ability to require less torque but with the trade off that you don't move as fast. Rear drives, because they don't use gears, need to rely on you the human. Not quite as fun. Luckily there is a work around, stick a bigger motor (which is not limited by chain strength) in the back wheel, and give it more torque via internal fixed gears (effectively increasing your RPM, which trades acceleration for cruising speed efficiency).

(For completeness, though don't do it **Front wheel**: The easiest setup and maintenance, the motor is in the front wheel. Because there are no cogs on the front wheel you can just pop off your old front wheel, pop on a new front wheel with a motor, and you're done. The down side is there's no weight on top of the front wheel so you have less traction and torque.)

#### Throttles and Pedal Assist

In a pedal assist motor, the motor is triggered by pedaling. With a throttle the motor is triggered with a thumb switch. If you can get it the throttle is super handy and more fun. Throttles are fun because you don't' need to pedal, and also very handy when stopped as it can take force to trigger the pedal assist if you're in the wrong gear.

Why don't all bike have Throttles? It turns out there are different classes of e-bikes (Class 1 vs Class 2), which are determined by if they have throttles, and their top speeds. The reason this matters is different areas have different rules for what class of e-bike can be on a sidewalk, and manufacturers serving those markets want the lowest (e.g. slowest) class of e-bike they can sell.

#### Torque vs Power vs Watts

Humans probably want to skip this section, but for my engineering friends here's the [skinny](https://www.ebikes.ca/learn/power-ratings.html). I barely understand this, here are my deep engineering ramblings which I'd love an engineer to explain to me in simple but accurate terms.

You care about acceleration, which requires force (mass x acceleration). Force isn't enough, you need to move something, which requires energy (force x distance). Which again isn't enough, as you need to normalize for time which is power (force x distance)/time. Power is measured in watts. Power isn't enough, as for a spinning motor, power is a function of rotational speed, e.g. RPM and torque. Power = Torque x RPM.

To make things more complex, Torque is a non-linear function of RPM (a motor property actually), and needs to be viewed on a power curve. At low RPM, e.g. when the wheel is moving slowly e.g. when going from a dead stop, or when due to a big hill, there isn't enough power to get the wheel spinning quickly, you have low power output.

To make things more complex, there is input electrical power, volts x amps, and then output power, which is effective force + wasted heat force. If you can't get the wheel to spin, you may have 100% input power, but 0% output effective power.

### E-Cargo Bike - The kid carrier - Rad Wagon

Most cargo bikes are mid-drive, and expensive, and not that fun to ride. The Rad Wagon has a direct rear-drive which has the lowest possible torque, but it's good enough for the flats and small hills and carrying your kid around.

Good parenting note, maximum speed and acceleration probably isn't the goal when you have your most precious cargo on the back of your bike.

### E-Every Day Bike - Rad mini step through

The rad mini has a geared rear drive, which has solid acceleration, and decent efficiency and is incredibly fun to ride. Several notes:

1. Get the step through, it doesn't look as cool, but it's always helpful to have your life be easier.
2. Despite the name, it's not a mini, it's huge by bike standards. Just mini compared to Rad Power's other giant e-bikes.
3. Despite being a folding bike, it's not portable or small folded down. At 75lbs you're going to need a few people to lift it, but at least you can get it into a car with folded down seats which wouldn't' be possible with the other giant bikes.

## Car Tech

I've gotten 3 cheap pieces of aftermarket tech that transformed my car to awesomeness:

- Remote car starter - ~ 200\$ and you can start your car from the house so that it's warm and toasty when you get in.
- Wireless Air Play - ~ 500\$. OMG - having CarPlay (especially on iOS 13) without plugging in your phone - wow!
- Back up Camera ~ 30\$. OMG - Hard to believe I went years without one.

## Morning Routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

I also love getting my morning hug from my kids, but now that Zach's older (9), I'm down to just getting the hugs from Amelia - who is 5.

### Weekend morning routine

On the weekends, the gym opens at 8, so it's essential I drink my coffee in my home office chair so I work on whatever is most important to me, often reading or writing. At 7:30 it's time to drag my but to the gym.

Post gym I'll either hit the coffee shop to do some more writing, or head home to spend the day with my family.

### Weekday morning routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

The gym opens at 5:30, and I try to be there by 6. After my work out, I often chillax with my next priority being walking the kids to school. Walking the kids to school has surprisingly been a major quality of life improvement for a very small impact to my day.

### Morning Kryptonite

I have two common failure modes to my morning routine.

- Starting my day by sitting in my easy chair drinking my coffee. This mindless activity has me skipping those things that are important to me.
- Hitting snooze when my alarm goes off. The worst of all words, not sleeping, and not being up and doing stuff.
- Lying in bed awake when I wake up before 5. Sometimes I wake up and can't fall back asleep @ 3 or 4 (which isn't crazy cuz sometimes I go to bed @ 7 or 8). Similar to hitting snooze, I'm not sleeping, and I'm not accomplishing anything.

## Tech Stuff

- iPhone Pro
- iPad Pro
- Apple Pencil
- Bluetooth Folding Split Keyboard
- AirPod Pros
- Bose 900 - Retired for the AirPod Pros
- Foam Tips for AirPod Pros - highly recommend if you're used to foam tips.
- iPad stand.

### Computers

- Huawei Matebook X (Essentially Windows Macbook clone):w
- Macbook Pro (usually at work)
- Ancient Desktop (upgrade coming)

### Monitors

- 34" wide screen - not a huge fan. Good for wide screen movies (but Netflix/YouTube rarely has this resolution)
- 40" 3840x2160 - Awesome, I love it! Highly recommend
