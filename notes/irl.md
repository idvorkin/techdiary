## Physical Health

[Physical Health](https://idvorkin.github.io/physical-health) - My original article on physical health
[Tech for health](http://idvorkin.github.io/tech-health-toys) - A list of tech products I've used and tried.

### Calf Health

When I crossed 40 I went from easily running 4 miles hard and 20 mile bike rides to have my calfs lock up after 20 minutes of biking. I've tried various calf things here's my current list:

* [Calf rocker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HTFZZ8/ref=emc_b_5_t) I have the single and double, best, simple stretch
* [Neoprene Calf Sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/Support-Brace-Adjustable-Splint-Compression/dp/B074734XJY/) I've tried socks but they are a pain to get on, and not adjustable. These things wrap on, keep you warm, and are wonderful. Highly recommend.

## Car Tech

I've gotten 3 cheap peices of aftermarket tech that transformed my car to awesomeness:

* Remote car starter - ~ 200$ and you can start your car from the house so that it's warm and toasty when you get in.
* Wireless Air Play - ~ 500$. OMG - having CarPlay (especially on iOS 13) without plugging in yoru phone - wow!
* Back up Camera ~ 30$.  OMG - Hard to believe I went years without one.
