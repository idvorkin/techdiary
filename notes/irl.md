## Physical Health

* [Physical Health](https://idvorkin.github.io/physical-health) - My original article on physical health
* [Tech for health](http://idvorkin.github.io/tech-health-toys) - A list of tech products I've used and tried.

### Calf Health

When I crossed 40 I went from easily running 4 miles hard and 20 mile bike rides to have my calfs lock up after 20 minutes of biking. I've tried various calf things here's my current list:

* [Calf rocker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HTFZZ8/ref=emc_b_5_t) I have the single and double, best, simple stretch
* [Neoprene Calf Sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/Support-Brace-Adjustable-Splint-Compression/dp/B074734XJY/) I've tried socks but they are a pain to get on, and not adjustable. These things wrap on, keep you warm, and are wonderful. Highly recommend.

### Knee Health

Lots of sleeves out there, I recommend the most flexible one that provides the pain relief. For me that:

* [Knee brace Softest ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BINV84/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Knee brace more support ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GDFN6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Knee Strap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GDFN6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MYGDB2L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Car Tech

I've gotten 3 cheap peices of aftermarket tech that transformed my car to awesomeness:

* Remote car starter - ~ 200$ and you can start your car from the house so that it's warm and toasty when you get in.
* Wireless Air Play - ~ 500$. OMG - having CarPlay (especially on iOS 13) without plugging in yoru phone - wow!
* Back up Camera ~ 30$.  OMG - Hard to believe I went years without one.

## Morning Routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am,  what ever comes first.

I also love getting my morning hug fromy my kids, but now that Zach's older (9), I'm down to just getting the hugs from Amelia - who is 5.

### Weekend morning routine

On the weekends, the gym opens at 8, so it's essential I drink my coffee in my home office chair so I work on whatever is most important to me, often reading or writing. At 7:30 it's time to drag my but to the gym.

Post gym I'll either hit the coffee shop to do some more writing, or head home to spend the day with my family.


### Weekday morning routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am,  what ever comes first.

The gym opens at 5:30, and I try to be there by 6. After my work out, I often chillax with my next priority being walking the kids to school.  Walking the kids to school has surprisingly been a major quality of life improvement for a very small impact to my day.


### Morning Kryptonite

I have two common failure modes to my morning routine.

* Starting my day by sitting in my easy chair drinking my coffee. This mindless activity has me skipping those things that are important to me.
* Hitting snooze when my alarm goes off. The worst of all words, not sleeping, and not being up and doing stuff.
* Lying in bed awake when I wake up before 5. Sometimes I wake up and can't fall back asleep @ 3 or 4 (which isn't crazy cuz sometimes I go to bed @ 7 or 8). Similar to hitting snooze, I'm not sleeping,  and I'm not accomplishing anything.
