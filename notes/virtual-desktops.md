## Tasks

#### Build Virtual Desktop Accesor

https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor
There is a C++ Bridge DLL that reexposes a nicer interface to the COM APIs.
Needs VS 2017 with C++ DLL to build and use.

- Can't build stdafx.h

This occurs if you clone using wsl. Clone from windows and it works.

- Random calls in the API fail

Don't care - ChangeDesktop is the only API I need to use, so will use that.
