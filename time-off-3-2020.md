### A note on Corona Virus

My time off correlated perfectly to the Corona Virus and as a result I wasted lots of my mental energy thinking about the Corona Virus, and adjusting to being in pseudo-quarantine. Took me a while, but I finally realized i should ignore it, or at least minimize my time thinking about it.

- Dude who wire walked the world trade towners [Phillipe Petit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Petit)

### iOS

#### ☐ Video Editting - Luma Fusion

### Books

#### ☐ How will you measure your life

Ideas:

Chapter 1:

Don't solve a problem, share a theory and give an example.
Theory is more important then data, as theory is predictive (Assuming correct theory), test of theory is its predictive power.

Funny story about data "everything that flies has wings", not predictive power.

Chapter 2:

Work Sat is two independant axis 1) Sat and 2) Hygiene

1. Sat is AMP
2. DSat is the extrinsic motivators

Money, annoying boss, nice office. !Hygiene does not equals Sat.

Chapter 3:

Strategy is deliberate and emmirgent, e.g. what you discover is more important then what you think. Flexibility and seeing what's most importan matters.

- Test core strategies assumptions (Irridium cell phone)

Chapter 4: How you spend your enegy is your actual strategy, and invest early.

Elilogue:

Being 100% committed easier then 98%.

98% means always need to think about it, and easy to give in. Juicing vs dieting

Chapter 5

- Too late to invest in family after it catches on fire
- Best time to invest is 100 years ago, next is today.
- Seems like don't need investments, but when need them you're screwed.
- Family, Health, Career all lines of business, and when one fails, needs all your attention, and you're screwed.

Chapter 6

- Focus on the job to be solved (Milkshakes)

You "hire" a product to solve a problem you have.

Crappy game company, but focused on problem - 12 minutes to play game.

Milkshake purpose 1) fun get to work snack - slow == good2) way to reward kids - fast == good. Diff products for diff time.

Chapter 7
Chapter 8
Chapter 9

#### ☑ StoryBrand

Using the hero's path to createa marketting plan. Also, helpful to clarify what your "business" really is.

Superb book. Very well written, and really speaks to the many, many, websites you see now a days.

Use their awesome [online companion tool](tool://www.mystorybrand.com/)

1. A charector (your customer **not** your business)
2. Has a problem (external, interal, philisophical)
3. Meets a guide (**your business**, empathy, authority)
4. Who gives them a plan (process, agreement)
5. And call them to action (direct, transitional)
6. That ends in success
7. And helps them avoid failure
8. Which results in a transformation (from, to)

Book well layed out:

- Why you need it
- SummaryWhat it is
- Combo What and How of doing it.
- How to do the nitty gritty on your web and org and etc.

Business Model of the company well layed out (customer value, franchises), and a great model of using this framework.

1. SMB owners
   1. Web Seminars
   1. Peronal Coaching
   1. IN person seminars
1. Medium Business owners
   1. Internal culture, business problems.
1. Coaches as franchises
   1. Training Selling to independnat franchisees who sell the method

Also an interesting business model for the book

#### ☐ Upstream Thinking Upstream

#### ☐ Inspired Product Management

#### ☐ HBR Thinking Strategically

#### ☐ Joy on Demand

[Seach inside yourself](https://idvork.in/search-inside-yourself) v2, focused on Joy.

#### ☑ 5 Dysfunctions of a team

Fast read:

- Lack of Trust
- Lack of Debate
- Lack of Commitment
- Lack of Accountability
- Lack of Delivering results

I think in modern terms:

1. Pyschological Safety
1. Healthy Debate
1. Disagree and Commit
1. Hold each othe accountable
1. Deliver value

#### ☐ Creativity

Meh book from the Phillipe Petit who walked the tightrope accross the world trade center and had other great adventures. Pretty meh book designed to inspire through "poetry", pretty meh.

### Family

#### Amelia

- ☑ Reading Matilda daily
- ☐ Roller Skating
- ☐ Bike Dates
- ☐ Somethign computer based(??)
- ☐ Daily Writing

#### Zach

- ☑ Watch Star Wars
- ☑ Work on website.
- ☐ Man dates
- ☐ Teach him to update his own games.
- ☐ Come up with test framework for games
- ☐ Figure out how to change things to markdown for him
- ☐ Code Combat

#### ☐ Tori

Don't worry, Tori is a big part of my energy, but she's private so we won't talk about that.

### Blog Tech

#### ☑ Clone tech diary into tech blog

[Some super cool shell-fu](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/blob/master/clone_td.sh)

#### ☐ Better broken link checker

#### ☑ Deep dive into CSS and bootstrap (great idea)

Quick notes [here](https://github.com/idvorkin/techdiary/blob/9e8e206a80219db32277459b00ae6773e3b61e62/notes/hack-web.md#fly-out-toc)

#### ☑ Redo CSS to be bootstrapped base

#### ☑ Create ToC

### vim

☑ Digraphs to support TODO and not-TODO

Digraphs let you use completion without needing GHFM which only works in lists.

☑ FZF super powers

Have C-O open interesting files across my repros and move there

☑ tags

Turns out there's a new version of [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/homebrew-universal-ctags), that support markdown, which you want for fzf :Tags

Also build interesting tag files for a markdown repo, by only using fd, which honors .gitignore

    ctags `fd md$`

☐ Community

Find the community:

1. Subscribed to rss feed for reddit via https://reddit/r/subreddit.rss
2. Find interesting discord

#### ☐ Screen cast of my cool setup

### Cut

#### Trip to Canada
